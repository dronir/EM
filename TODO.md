## Version 2.0

Next version will probably bump the number to 2.x because of
backwards incompatible API changes, if semantic versioning is to be
followed.

- Start following [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
- Rename `fit_2hg` something more sensible.
- Figure out how the X-ray codes work and document
- Improve documentation of other codes
- Make tests for all codes and automate them.
- Make the path determination for the build automatic
- Sort out the Python scripts in `python/`

- As a side note: Make the homebrew recipe for xraylib
