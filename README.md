# EM

A code for ray-trace simulations of visible light and X-rays in particulate media.

Originally written by Hannu Parviainen, this branch developed by Olli Wilkman.

Everything's a bit of a mess at this point. Documentation is almost nonexistent.

The programs have been successfully compiled and ran on Linux and OS X 10.7 Lion.

No documentation on how to actually use the programs exists at the moment.
