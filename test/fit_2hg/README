== Testing fit_2hg

After building and compiling fit_2hg, you can test it by running

$ ./../../bin/fit_2hg fit_2hg_test.in

This will read the input file fin_2hg_test.in and run the program
using the medium file medium_rho_035.nc and the photometry file
nadir_noise.nc in this directory, as well as some simple parameter
values which should give a very short execution time.

The program should produce a file called dscatter.scangles in
this directory, containing the output.

TODO: actually document what the program does, and what the input
and output files contain.
